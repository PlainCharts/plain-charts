# Changelog

All notable changes documented here.

Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed
- Stats bar: removed the History surface's bottom stats strip and its Trade Desk > Configure > Stats tab (the reorderable, on/off stat list); a dedicated Stats surface replaces it

### Changed
- Symbol dialog: browse MetaTrader 5 instruments in a tree built from the broker's own symbol groups, with each symbol's broker description
- Symbol dialog: clear (✕) button in the search box that wipes the text in one click without closing the dialog
- Symbol dialog: browse CQG instruments in a tree (group / exchange / instrument type) beside the search, with a saved exchange filter and per-broker recents

### Fixed
- Order dialog: opening it now picks up a stop that was dragged on the chart while it was closed; a stale startup snapshot no longer wins over the live plan
- Symbol dialog: CQG search now matches by symbol code (e.g. EP), not only by description
- Order ticket: the window now grows to fit your quick buttons instead of squishing the form and hiding Buy/Sell
- Order ticket: a rejected modify on a pending order now shows the error in the ticket status line instead of nothing
